## *Why Will It Not Work On Android/IOS Directly?*
<pre>
-> Android/IOS Are GUI Based UI But Slang is Still in Console. But, You Can Still Run It On Android Using Termux!

-> Windows/Linux/Other Desktop OS Support Console GUI (Eg: Windows Command Prompt, Terminal, etc.);
</pre>

## *Why Will It Not Be Released On Mac?*
<pre>
-> As A Student, I Can't Afford A Buy Mac Yet.
Also, I Would Not Want To Illegally Install Mac On A Windows Device.
